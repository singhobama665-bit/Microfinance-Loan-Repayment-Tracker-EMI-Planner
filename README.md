# Microfinance-Loan-Repayment-Tracker-EMI-Planner.
Project 38 : Microfinance Loan Repayment Tracker & EMI Planner 
Real-world context: Microfinance institutions track many small loans, repayment schedules, delinquencies, and interest accrual. 
Problem description (detailed): 
Develop a system that: 
Stores borrower records and loan contracts (principal, rate, tenure, EMI schedule, outstanding balance). 
Generates EMI schedules using amortization formula, accepts repayments (partial/full), updates balances, computes penalties for overdue payments, and recalculates remaining EMIs. 
Supports portfolio reports: total outstanding, delinquency rate, borrower ranking by risk score computed from repayment history. 
Use structures for borrower/loan, functions for amortization and penalty computation, arrays for multiple loans, pointers for dynamic portfolio expansion, and file I/O to persist loan books. 
Provide dashboard summaries (text) and per-borrower repayment history. 
Syllabus topics applied: Problem solving, arithmetic & floating operations, decision making, loops, arrays, functions, structures, pointers, dynamic memory, file I/O. 
CO mapping: 
CO1 : design repayment & penalty flowcharts; 
CO2 : implement EMI math and validation; 
CO3 : use arrays/functions for portfolio analytics; 
CO4 : use pointers/dynamic memory for loan book growth; 
CO5 : design a modular microfinance management solution.
